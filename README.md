### Current Implementation

I have successfully implemented the core functionalities of the application as per the initial requirements. Here’s a summary of what has been achieved:

1. **API Integration:** I have set up the API call functionality, but encountered CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues that prevented the API from being accessed directly from the localhost. Due to these constraints and limited time, I utilized demo data to ensure that the application's core features are functional. This approach allowed me to demonstrate the intended functionality and UI despite the API access issues.

2. **UI Development:** The user interface has been developed to closely align with the design specifications provided. I have focused on creating a seamless and visually appealing experience, though certain design elements may be refined further with more detailed design assets.

3. **Navigation and Data Fetching:** Upon opening the application, users are directed to the meeting page. I have implemented data fetching using `useEffect` to populate the UI with dynamic content. This ensures that the application is responsive and data-driven.

4. **Future Improvements:** While I have implemented the primary functionalities and designed the UI to the best of my ability within the given timeframe, there are several areas where the application can be enhanced:
   - **Loading and Preloading:** Implementing correlated loading or preloading strategies using React Router DOM to improve user experience. This will provide smoother transitions and reduce perceived loading times.
   - **Design Refinements:** With access to the complete Figma design files and additional time, I could further refine the UI to match the exact design specifications and enhance overall usability.

### Potential for Further Development

Given more time and access to detailed design resources, such as Figma files, I am confident in my ability to significantly improve the application. Here’s what can be achieved with these resources:

- **Enhanced API Integration:** Full implementation of API functionality with accurate data handling.
- **Advanced UI/UX Features:** Refinement of the user interface and experience to fully align with design requirements and ensure a polished final product.
- **Optimized Performance:** Incorporation of advanced techniques for improved performance and user experience.
